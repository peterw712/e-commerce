# E-commerce Backend

## Description

The backend for an e-commerce website. Uses CRUD operations to query a database made with Sequelize ORM.

## Future development

Associate products with tags for the tag POST routes.

## Challenges

I don't know why product POST and PUT routes give me bad request, but still work?

## Installation
In npm, install sequelize and express. Start mysql in the terminal, use schema.sql as a source, ```npm run seed``` in the terminal, and then ```npm start```.
